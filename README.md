With every project we're assigned , I have the hardest time with brainstorming ideas and just deciding what to do. I am not the best in terms of the creative department but with every website I've visited, I value 2 key things, simplicity and dark mode(necessary). With the current given times , we are in front of the computer more than ever and it's always best to view sites that aren't super bright. I created this website named my life , my vida etc... to show my love for the foods I have eaten in the past.

Features to add later: User login/authentication so posts can't be deleted unless logged in
I would like to also let users upload images but does mongoatlas store image files? As for as I can tell, mongoatlas is simply an array with key value pairs..
